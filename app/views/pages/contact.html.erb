			<h3>Contact me</h3>
			<div class="writing-container">
				<p>Feel free to send me an email at <%= mail_to "brockgolden@gmail.com" %>. I'll try to get back to you as quickly as possible. I'm also pretty responsive via Twitter as <%= link_to "@GOLDNGRAMS", "https://twitter.com/GOLDNGRAMS" %>.</p>
				<p>If you make good music, send it down to <%= mail_to "goldngrams@earmilk.com" %> and I can put it through some channels. I try to run through my demo and promo inbox as much as I can, and I usually respond immediately when I'm really feeling your work. Unfortunately I can't give feedback to everyone, so if you don't get a response after about a week, I just wasn't feeling it that's all.</p>
